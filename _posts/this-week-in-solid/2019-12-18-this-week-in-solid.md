# This Year in Solid 2019

Hello and welcome to a special edition of This Week in Solid!

[Solid](https://solidproject.org) is a standard that allows users to switch between storage and app while taking the data along. 

This is the last edition of 2019 so here's a recap of This Year in Solid to look at the highlights of the year. 

### solidproject.org is live and up to date 
At the start of the year information about Solid was dispersed over various location, by different people, sometimes duplicated and even conflicting. Over the year we have come together to collect the information about Solid in a single repository (which was called 'Information'). This was the base content used to build solidproject.org which was put together with a lot of hard work from the [Creators](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/master/creators.md). This website is being maintained regularly so that it is up to date with the latest information. 

### A mailing list was set up 
[This Week in Solid](https://solidproject.org/this-week-in-solid) has been set up as a touch point to easily stay in the loop and share information with each other. Rather than having to check many channels and reach out to several people This Week in Solid has meant people working on Solid are more in the loop with what's going on. 

### A record of who is working on what, where 
The community around Solid has grown considerably, meaning that more and more people are contributing, and knowing how to slot in as a newcomer or how to get an overview of what others are working on and how to work together is more complex. Over the year we have worked on [recording who works on what and where](https://github.com/solid/process) so that newcomers know how to support others and when to start new projects. In particular, the process for improving the Solid standard has been defined along with teams defined by expertise and responsibility and shared [milestones](https://github.com/solid/specification/milestones). Tomorrow during the W3C Solid Community Call we will do a gap analysis of the first milestone where we can also talk about the effectiveness of the process so far. Tune in at 1600 CET on December 19th on [this line](https://zoom.us/j/261297657) to join in. 

### Weekly recurring and well attended calls on specific themes to develop Solid 
Every Thursday there has been a [W3C Solid Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/) alternating between 1600CET and 1000CET. On top of that there have been more in depth calls on specific topics such as authentication, data interoperability, and authorisation. [Read more](https://solidproject.org/standardisation) about when these calls are if you are interested in joining.

### 25 Solid Events 
Over 2019 we had 25 [Solid Events](https://solidproject.org/events) in 18 locations in the USA, Europe, and China. Solid Events have been a great way for local communities to form around their interest in Solid. Thank you to all the hard work by the event organisers for making this happen! Anyone can become a Solid Event organiser. [Reach out to other Solid Event organisers](https://gitter.im/solid/solid-events) or contact the Solid Manager if you would like to brainstorm ideas and learn how to make a successful local community.  

### 60+ talks and 150+ articles mentioning Solid
Over the year there have been more than sixty [talks mentioning Solid](https://solidproject.org/press) along with [150+ articles](https://solidproject.org/press). Looking forward to many more in the coming year. 

### Solid standardisation work
The Solid standard is still a work in progress. At the start of the year Solid was being worked on in several different respositories asynchronously by many people with a variety of focuses. Now, there is a clear agreed destination where to put the final result as well as defined [milestones](https://github.com/solid/specification/milestones). Work on the test suite which is incorporated in to the Solid standard has also started led by Kjetil Kjernsmo. 

### The Solid properties have been collected and maintained by the Administrators 
Solid properties, such as domains, hosting, and chat tools were organised organically by a variety of people meaning that when services needed maintenance it was not clear who was able to carry that out. This year a defined group called the [Administrators](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/master/administrators.md) have been carefully collecting and maintaining Solid properties to ensure consistent maintenance and a single touch point to flag issues. 

### More extensive and organised documentation for developers working with Solid 
As part of the Solid website launch a major effort went underway to collect [material for developers](https://solidproject.org/for-developers) as well as mature the content. Some big advances include [triple doc](https://vincenttunru.gitlab.io/tripledoc/) and an [exploration of client-side RDF libraries](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-lib-comparison). 

### Course teaching how to build a Solid app at University of Oviedo led by [Jose Emilio Labra Gayo](http://labra.weso.es)
Last year, the students that attended the course "Software Architecture" participated in the Solid chat challenge. It consisted in the development of a Solid chat app as part of the course assignment. The course is taught in the second semester, 3rd year, of the Bachelor degree in Software Engineering at the School of Computer Science from the University of Oviedo, Spain. The students were grouped in teams of 4-8 students and had to describe the architecture of the app and to implement a prototype using open source software. The total number of students that participated was 116. An important aspect is that the students had previous knowledge of programming languages like Java or JavaScript, but 85% of the students didn't even know that RDF existed, and as the course was about Software architecture, the teachers didn't have time to explain RDF or semantic technologies properly. So part of the challenge was also to see how students could develop a Solid app without prior knowledge of those subjects or having to learn those subjects by themselves. In general, the students succeeded to create the Solid chat apps and 14 projects were presented, which are available at the course web page. A Jury was formed by 2 people of Inrupt and one teacher to select the winner project. During the presentation of the results, Mitzi L치szl칩, from Inrupt, gave a talk about Solid and we invited several local companies to the event. The companies Empathy, Izertis and The-Cocktail were interested to sponsor some of the students which continue developing some projects using Solid.  

### Several teams working full time to implement Solid in practice 
The Solid standard needs to be implemented to demonstrate it in practice. Here are few updates from the teams who have been busy with this: 
* [**Inrupt**](https://inrupt.com):
  * January 2019 saw the first public release (v0.1.0) of the new Solid React SDK with a new emphasis on supporting React. [Read more](https://jmartin.inrupt.net/public/docs/year-in-review.html) on the SDK work. 
  * Also, in 2019 the data browser team at inrupt has supported the development of the Solid Data Browser by making it easier to develop the project itself via [mashlib-dev](https://github.com/inrupt/mashlib-dev). The team 
[also](https://github.com/solid/mashlib/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) 
[fixed](https://github.com/solid/solid-panes/pulls?page=2&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed&utf8=%E2%9C%93) 
[many](https://github.com/solid/solid-ui/pulls?page=2&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed&utf8=%E2%9C%93) 
[issues](https://github.com/solid/chat-pane/pulls?page=2&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed&utf8=%E2%9C%93) 
[and](https://github.com/solid/contacts-pane/pulls?page=2&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed&utf8=%E2%9C%93) 
[bugs](https://github.com/solid/folder-pane/pulls?page=2&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed&utf8=%E2%9C%93) 
[in](https://github.com/solid/issue-pane/pulls?page=2&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed&utf8=%E2%9C%93) 
[the](https://github.com/solid/meeting-pane/pulls?page=2&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed&utf8=%E2%9C%93) 
[related](https://github.com/solid/source-pane/pulls?page=2&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed&utf8=%E2%9C%93) 
[projects](https://github.com/solid/pane-registry/pulls?page=2&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed&utf8=%E2%9C%93), as well as 
contributing to related tools such as [rdflib](https://github.com/linkeddata/rdflib.js).
    * Major contributions that the team has undertaken is the introduction of global elements such as the header, dashboard, 
and user menu. The team also introduced [user roles](https://github.com/solid/userguide/blob/master/appendix/userroles.md) 
that allow people to better tailor their experience with the data browser, as well as removing some of the confusing 
features from users that are new to the data browser. Lastly, the team started migrating the code to TypeScript, which 
allow them to maintain the code better and introduce less bugs.
    * The data browser is a large project with many potential use-cases, and the team spent quite a bit of time to plan how they 
want to continue the development. In 2020 they will share the results of this work with everyone, and you can expect to 
see more documentation such as roadmaps and more involvement with other teams to shape the future of the data browser.
    * As always, the team is open for discussion [on the forum](https://forum.solidproject.org/c/build-a-solid-app/solid-data-browser).
* [**Empathy**](https://www.empathy.co): At Empathy.co we envision an e-commerce search based on the Solid where user rights and data control prevails. We envision an e-commerce search based on data stored in Pods where relevant results could depend on context data stored by the user & privacy relies on it. We think that if we want to see this succeeding, the Pod management needs to be a Pod experience. Something that the user sees as a projection of themselves, something they love to feel endorsed by & they want to see it as a part of the 'I'. That's why we are working on the UX/UI Pod experience" To get in touch reach out to ...

## Wishlist and what to look forward to in 2020
There's plenty of work to carry out in the year to come. Here's a little list of things that people have mentioned they would love to see happen in 2020: stable standard, improved onboarding, user friendly apps, multiple Pod implementations, and better developing tools. 
* At CERN, the birthplace of the web, a group will be meeting to talk about work on Solid. [Read more](https://indico.cern.ch/e/CERN-Solid-brainstorming) about the Solid event at CERN. 
* There are already a few [Solid Events](https://solidproject.org/events) and [talks](https://solidproject.org/press) about Solid, more coming soon 

Until next year :)
